## Project Overview

Today we all are familiar with OpenAI ChatGPT, bard and we all use it in our day to day life in some or another way. But to run these applications, having a stable internet connection is important which means if we don’t have internet then we will be not able to utilize any of these technology which have make our life very easy.

Think of a situation when you want to ask question from Google but you have no internet or not a stable internet connection?

In short, using all these applications require internet. There are many people who can’t afford this due to the high cost of data. Even if companies like Jio have helped us in accessing internet but still there are many people who can’t afford even that plans.  We believe that information is power and making information more accessible will only stand to make life more convenient for everyone!

## What it does?

Saathi is a solution that allows users to get answers or help from Google Generative-AI as well as OpenAI language model by sending a prompt or question via a text message to our server. The user then gets a response to their question in a matter of seconds.

As texting is not always convenient for non-smart cell phone users, another option is to call the line and our interactive voice response system will listen to the user's question and will respond to it both verbally and with a text message, so that the user can reference that information at a later time after the call.
